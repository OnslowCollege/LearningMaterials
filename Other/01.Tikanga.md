# Koronga ako • Learning intentions

**In this lesson, you will learn**:

- what "kawa" and "tikanga" mean
- why kawa and tikanga are important to our kura and computer labs
- what the kawa for our computer labs are
- to co-construct tikanga for our class

# Kawa & tikanga

## Kawa

In te reo Māori, "Kawa" refers to the rules and protocols that **must** be followed in certain situations. For example, the New Zealand government says that students **must** not use their cellphones during school time.

## Tikanga

On the other hand, tikanga are the protocols that have been agreed by a given group as the best way to uphold the kawa. For example, at Onslow College, we have a Cellphone Use Policy to deal with when students use their cellphones at school

# Kawa & tikanga

<div class="columns">

<div>

Remember: kawa are the rules and protocols that **must** be followed.

In these computer labs, the kawa is derived from the school's five core values:

- [Manaakitanga](#kawa-manaakitanga)
- [Pursuing growth](#kawa-pursuing-growth)
- [Whanaungatanga](#kawa-whanaungatanga)
- [Valuing diversity](#kawa-valuing-diversity)
- [Kaitiakitanga](#kawa-kaitiakitanga)

</div>

<div>

## Task

1. Split into five evenly-sized groups
2. Your kaiako will assign a kawa to you
3. Read the information on each kawa from the next few slides
4. On your pieces of paper, brainstorm at least **FIVE** (5) different ways we could fulfil the kawa in our class

**Example**: to show 'pursuing growth', we make sure to turn in assignments on time

# Kawa: manaakitanga

<span class="quote">"We nurture and treat each other with respect and generosity."</span>

The kawa for this value is as follows:

- We show respect for each other
- We make everybody feel included
- We provide support and encouragement for each other
- We care for each other's success, not just our own

---

# Kawa: pursuing growth

<span class="quote">"We strive to grow and achieve together, to consistently pursue our goals with determination, and to value life-long learning."</span>

The kawa for this value is as follows:

- We understand what is expected of us
- We do our best to work towards those expectations
- We manage our time well
- When we have difficulties meeting those expectations, we seek clarification
- At the same time, we embrace challenges and stay curious

---

# Kawa: whanaungatanga

<span class="quote">"We value and grow relationships. We take the time to know each other and work to make sure that everyone can feel safe and thrive."</span>

The kawa for this value is as follows:

- We get to know everybody in their class
- We seek new points of view from people we don't know as well
- We don't always work with just our friends

---

# Kawa: valuing diversity

<span class="quote">"We are inclusive and respectful of all the many ways of being that make us who we are as unique individuals and as a community."</span>

The kawa for this value is as follows:

- We never make anybody in our class feel bad for being different from us
- We don't dismiss other peoples' values
- We take time to understand and learn from each other
- We don't accept or perpetuate harmful stereotypes

---

# Kawa: kaitiakitanga

<span class="quote">"We recognise our responsibilities to protect and look after our environments and the things that we value to support our own and our community’s wellbeing."</span>

The kawa for this value is as follows:

- we take care of the classroom environment
- we take preventative steps to ensure the classroom environment is not harmed
- we take responsibility for any damage to the computer equipment that we may cause

---

# Tikanga

Once each group has come up with at least **FIVE** (5) different ways to fulfil each kawa, we can create a set of rules for our class

These rules will be our **tikanga**, the protocol we expect from everybody in our class

This includes both ākonga **and** kaiako

# Whakamutunga • Conclusion

Now that this lesson has concluded, how confident are you that you know:

- what "kawa" and "tikanga" mean?
- why kawa and tikanga are important to our kura and computer labs?
- what the kawa for our computer labs are?
